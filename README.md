## Creating a New Article

You can use this as a template to create an article for ArXiv. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
quarto use template PeterBloomingdale/arxiv
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file and bibiography that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Installation For Existing Document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. From the quarto project or document directory, run the following command to install this format:

```bash
quarto install extension PeterBloomingdale/arxiv
```
